        <h3>A beautiful Burrata appetizer</h3>
        <p>It’s a fresh Italian cheese made from cow’s milk. In the store, it looks a lot like fresh mozzarella, because it comes in balls. In fact, each ball is a pouch of fresh mozzarella filled with rich, fresh cream.</p>
        <p>You can find burrata in speciality cheese shops or most grocery stores with a good cheese section. It pairs well with both sweet and savory flavors, so I made this recipe with a jumble of stone fruit, tomatoes, and fresh herbs.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Burrata</li>
            <li>Fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the oil, garlic, lemon peel, and thyme in a small saucepan over low heat.</li>
                <li>Gently warm the mixture, then turn off the heat. Let steep for 20 minutes, then strain.</li>
                <li>Assemble the tomatoes, peach slices, and burrata on a platter. Sprinkle with salt, then drizzle with lemon-thyme oil.</li>
                <li>Top with the basil and mint and sprinkle with pistachios. Top with cherries and currants, if desired. </li>

            </ol>
